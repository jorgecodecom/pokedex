# Pokedex

Small React application to see pokemon characteristics like name, picture, ID number and the type of attack.
This is a test for Adalab.
[Go to the application](https://jorgecodecom.github.io/pokedex)

The data comes from the [PokeApi] API (https://pokeapi.co).
Requests are limited by day, please do not make too many requests.
That was the reason why I limited the pages to 50 items.

## Installation
```sh
$ cd pokedex
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## TODOs
