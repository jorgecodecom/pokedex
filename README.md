# Pokedex

Small React application to see pokemon characteristics like name, picture, ID number and the type of attack.
This is a test for Adalab.
[Go to the application] (http://jorgecode.com/jorge/pokemon)

The data comes from the [PokeApi] API (https://pokeapi.co).
Requests are limited by day, please do not make too many requests.
That was the reason why I limited the pages to 50 items.
